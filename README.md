Updated my project from words counter to productive web app for students, they can save articles, keypoints, annotations and drafts just by 1 click, texts will be saved to 4 different graph.

Why is it useful? 
I as a student always getting mixed up on different chrome or word tabs by looking and typing down recourses from different web, i wished i could have 1 tab where i could type out everything, put it down to 1 channel, and manage my recourses from there.

features include:
Typing and managing recourses
Saving recourses on same tab
keeping track of words while typing
delete all 4 graphs by one click (system doublechecks if you really wish to delete all the recourses)
